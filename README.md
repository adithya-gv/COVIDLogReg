## Updates
June 24, 2020: Created the basic logistic regression algorithm to fit a curve to the data.

June 25, 2020: Updated the algorithm to attempt to calculate the inflection point and created basic predictions for 1 day, 10 day and 50 day future outlooks.

July 4, 2020: Updated the algorithm with a more accurate algorithm to estimate the inflection point, now basing it off more on the shape of the data.
