## Updates
June 24, 2020: Created the basic logistic regression algorithm to fit a curve to the data.

June 25, 2020: Updated the algorithm to attempt to calculate the inflection point and created basic predictions for 1 day, 10 day and 50 day future outlooks.

July 4, 2020: Updated the algorithm with a more accurate algorithm to estimate the inflection point, now basing it off more on the shape of the data.

July 12, 2020: Fixed print output bug where there would be no space between the colon and the case count.

July 15, 2020: Created Scraper Tool to automatically update case counts using data from covidtracking.com and the JSON API.
